========

Python Reconstruction Operators in Machine Learning (PYRO-NN-Layers) brings state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithm to
neuralnetwork integrated into Tensorflow. This Repository contains the actual Layer implementation as CUDA kernels and 
the necessary C++ Information Control Classes according to Tensorflow API.

For convinient use of the layers also install https://github.com/csyben/PYRO-NN
